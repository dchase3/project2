      <h2>Origin of My Gaming</h2>
      <p>
        The first time I every really noticed video games was when my parents bought my older
        sister a Playstation2. All three of the kids in the family started gathering around on
        the weekends to play a game called Sly Cooper. Within a year we had mastered this game 
        and all of it's sequels, as well as amassing a a much larger selection of games. Since
        my first experiences with video games I have loved playing them, watching them being made,
        and seeing how they can bring groups together. Currently I am hoping to have a career in the
        video game industry, because I believe they are some of the best forms of entertainment and
        enjoyment in my life, and I would like to share that with others.
