        <h2>Growing Up</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in a town called Naperville, about 30 miles away from Chicago. My household
          consisted of my parents, my brother, my sister and myself. I attended Naperville
          Central High School, which was one of two different rival schools in the town. After 
          graduating high school I wanted to lay a path out that would end in me being about to
          help make video games for a living. I decided to attend IIT, The Illinois Institute of
          Technology, as a CS major to attempt to make this a reality. Since then I have switched
          over to an ITM major but I am currently still hoping to have a career in the video game
          industry.

        <h2>Gymnastics</h2>
        <p>
          My absolute favorite series of all time is the classical Star Wars movies. So as a kid I was so 
          excited when the prequel movies came out. When Attack of the Clones came out Lucas Film finally
          showed Yoda fighting with a lightsaber. Of course this was all CGI, but as a kid I always thought
          That it was actually happening. Naturally I wanted to be a Jedi when I grew up, so this scene in
          the movie told me that I needed to learn gymnastics before I could become a Jedi. That is the story
          of how I started to do gymnastics, which I went on to do for over a decade of my life, and competed
          for throughout my high school life.
